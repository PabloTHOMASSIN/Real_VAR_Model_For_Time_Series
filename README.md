ESILV A4 Project "Real VAR - Advanced Time Series Analysis"

## Introduction
Hello everyone,

Welcome to our ESILV A4 project: "Real VAR - Advanced Time Series Analysis." This project delves deep into the realm of time series analysis, specifically focusing on Vector Autoregression (VAR) models and their applications in real-world scenarios.

In this GitHub repository, we have consolidated all the essential components of our project, including Python code implementations, documentation, and relevant resources. Our primary goal is to explore the intricacies of VAR models and demonstrate their utility in analyzing complex time series data, capturing interdependencies among multiple variables.

Through this project, we aim to provide insights into advanced time series analysis techniques and showcase practical applications of VAR models in forecasting, causality analysis, and policy evaluation.

We encourage you to delve into our GitHub repository and engage with us by sharing your insights, feedback, or questions. Your participation is crucial in fostering collaboration and advancing our understanding of advanced time series analysis.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through the world of Real VAR - Advanced Time Series Analysis!

Best regards,
